# EduPath
I made this app to help high school students who would like to enroll UH Manoa to plan their academic programs and their career pathways. The list of courses is from the University of Hawaii website. The list of occupations is from the US Government website. 

To run the app, please put your API key into the file config.js, then double click on the file index.html.
